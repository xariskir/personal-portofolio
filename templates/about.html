    <div class="about-content">
        <p class="about-lead">
            I am a Data Analyst and Machine Learning Engineer with a strong academic background
            in computer engineering and data science, focused on building data-driven and AI-powered
            solutions that deliver measurable business value.
        </p>

        <p>
            My journey began in computer engineering, where I developed a solid foundation in
            programming, systems, and applied mathematics. Over the years, I transitioned deeper
            into data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, combining theory
            with real-world business applications.
        </p>

        <p>
            I specialize in transforming raw data into insights, predictive models, and intelligent
            systems. My work spans data analysis, machine learning pipelines, cloud-based AI services,
            and automation, always with an emphasis on clarity, reliability, and practical impact.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond the technical aspects, I bring experience in business operations and ERP systems,
            allowing me to bridge the gap between data, technology, and decision-making.
            I value clean design, explainable results, and solutions that stakeholders can trust.
        </p>
